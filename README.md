## TabMemFree

TabMemFree â€” is a Chrome extension that lowers RAM/CPU load by "parking" inactive tabs.

Parking is made by navigating tab to an empty page similar to `about:blank`.
Later on, when you click on a parked tab, it is sent back to the original page by making a step "back" in it's history.
The side effect is that "forward" history of a tab may be lost.
